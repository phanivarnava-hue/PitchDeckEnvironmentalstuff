# Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Clarity CSRD (working title)

**The Job to be Done:**
"When my company faces CSRD reporting deadlines, I want an automated system that collects the right sustainability data and generates compliant reports, so I avoid fines, satisfy investors, and keep my job without hiring an army of consultants."

**Market Opportunity:**
- 50,000+ EU companies must comply (phased 2026-2028)
- Netherlands: ~1,000 companies in scope
- €30K-€120K per customer annually
- €12M revenue potential by Year 3 (Netherlands)
- €50M+ potential by Year 5 (EU expansion)

**Why Now:**
- CSRD reporting starts 2026-2027 (companies reporting NOW are panicking)

# Part 1: Understanding the Job (JTBD Framework)

## The Struggling Moment

**Meet Sarah, Head of Sustainability at MidCorp BV (€500M revenue):**

*It's March 2026. Sarah just learned her company must produce their first CSRD report by March 2028 (covering FY 2027). She has 24 months.*

**Her Current Situation (The Struggle):**
- Must collect 1,000+ data points across environmental, social, governance topics
- Data is scattered: emissions (facilities team), labor (HR), supply chain (procurement), board diversity (legal), water use (operations)
- Nobody has done this before at her company
- Hired €200K worth of consultants - they gave her 300-page framework documents
- CFO is asking: "How much will this cost?" She has no idea
- Investors are calling: "When will we see your CSRD data?"
- She's drowning in Excel spreadsheets
- **Her real fear:** "I'm going to fail at this and get fired"

## The Four Forces of Progress

### PUSH FORCES (Why Change is Urgent) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

These are the problems pushing Sarah away from her current situation:

**1. Legal Mandate (Extreme Push)**
- EU law - non-compliance = fines
- 2027-2028 deadlines are IMMINENT
- Her company WILL be audited on this data
- Personal liability: "If we get fined, is it my fault?"

**2. Investor Pressure (Extreme Push)**
- ESG funds require CSRD data to invest
- Current investors demanding transparency
- Board asking in every meeting: "Where are we with CSRD?"
- Stock price could suffer if seen as non-compliant

**3. Internal Chaos (Very High Push)**
- Data scattered across 10+ departments
- No central system
- Facilities team uses different metrics than procurement
- Previous year's data doesn't exist in right format
- Manual Excel compilation = weeks of work
- Errors everywhere (wrong units, missing data, duplicates)

**4. Consultant Fatigue (High Push)**
- Already spent €200K on KPMG consultants
- They provided frameworks, but Sarah still has to DO the work
- Consultants can't access company systems (security)
- Every question = another €300/hour charge
- Feeling: "I'm paying them to tell me what I already know"

**5. Complexity Overwhelm (Very High Push)**
- ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards) = 1,000+ pages
- "Double materiality" assessment = confusing concept
- 10+ different ESG standards (GRI, TCFD, SASB) - which applies?
- December 2025 rule changes = "Did the rules change again?!"
- Technical language: "Scope 3 Category 11 emissions" = what?

**6. Timeline Pressure (Extreme Push)**
- 24 months sounds like a lot
- Reality: Need 6 months just to understand requirements
- Another 12 months to collect historical data
- 3 months for audit preparation
- 3 months buffer for errors/corrections
- **She's already behind**

**7. Career Risk (Personal Push)**
- Sarah was hired specifically for this
- If she fails, she's out
- Her professional reputation is on the line
- Competitors at other companies are already ahead
- Fear: "Everyone will see we failed when report is published"

### PULL FORCES (Vision of Better Life) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

These are the attractive outcomes pulling Sarah toward a solution:

**1. Automated Data Collection**
- "Connect to all our systems once, data flows automatically"
- No more emailing 20 department heads for spreadsheets
- Real-time dashboard showing data completeness
- **Feeling:** Relief, control, confidence

**2. Compliance Confidence**
- "Know we're meeting every ESRS requirement"
- Built-in checks: "You're missing Scope 3 Category 8 data"
- Pre-audit validation: "Your report will pass audit"
- **Feeling:** Sleep at night, no anxiety

**3. Time Savings**
- Current: 3 weeks to compile one report section
- With platform: 3 hours to review auto-generated section
- Sarah gets her life back
- Can focus on strategy instead of Excel hell
- **Feeling:** Professional, competent, efficient

**4. Career Win**
- Sarah becomes the hero: "She nailed CSRD implementation"
- Promoted or recruited by bigger company
- Speaking at conferences: "How we solved CSRD"
- LinkedIn posts: "Proud to announce our first CSRD report"
- **Feeling:** Pride, recognition, security

**5. Stakeholder Satisfaction**
- CFO: "Lower cost than I expected"
- CEO: "Investors are impressed with our report"
- Board: "We're ahead of competitors"
- Auditors: "Cleanest CSRD data we've seen"
- **Feeling:** Respect, trust, political capital

**6. Beautiful Reports**
- Not just compliance, but actually impressive
- Benchmarking: "We're in top 25% for carbon efficiency"
- Visualizations that tell a story
- Investor relations uses it in presentations
- **Feeling:** Pride in work quality

**7. Future-Proofing**
- Next year's report takes 1 week, not 6 months
- System evolves as regulations change
- Built-in updates when ESRS standards change
- **Feeling:** Long-term security, strategic asset

### ANXIETY FORCES (Fears About New Solution) ⭐⭐

These are Sarah's fears about adopting your platform:

**1. "What if it doesn't actually work?"**
- "Sounds too good to be true"
- "We'll waste 6 months and still need consultants"
- **How we reduce:** Free trial, pilot program, case studies

**2. "Is our data secure?"**
- "We're uploading sensitive business data"
- "What if there's a breach?"
- **How we reduce:** SOC2 certification, EU data hosting, encryption

**3. "Will it integrate with our systems?"**
- "We use SAP, they probably only support simple tools"
- "Our ERP is custom, won't work"
- **How we reduce:** Pre-built connectors, API documentation, custom integration support

**4. "Can my team actually use this?"**
- "I'm not technical, this looks complex"
- "Will I need to hire developers?"
- **How we reduce:** No-code interface, onboarding support, video tutorials

**5. "What if regulations change?"**
- "We implement this, then ESRS changes and platform is outdated"
- **How we reduce:** Automatic updates, change notifications, included in subscription

**6. "What's the real cost?"**
- "€50K/year sounds good, but what about hidden fees?"
- "Implementation costs, consulting, training?"
- **How we reduce:** Transparent all-in pricing, fixed implementation fee

### INERTIA FORCES (Attachment to Current Way) ⭐

These are the habits/comfort with current approach:

**1. "We've already invested in consultants"**
- Sunk cost fallacy: "We paid €200K to KPMG"
- **Why inertia is LOW:** Consultants haven't solved the problem

**2. "Excel is familiar"**
- Everyone knows how to use spreadsheets
- **Why inertia is LOW:** But Excel is clearly not working (chaos)

**3. "We might not need software"**
- "Maybe we can hire someone to do this manually"
- **Why inertia is LOW:** Timeline pressure makes manual approach impossible

**4. "Change is hard"**
- Need to convince IT, security, legal, finance to approve
- **Why inertia is LOW:** But legal mandate forces change anyway

**Overall Inertia Assessment:** LOW - CSRD is brand new requirement, no established "old way", urgency overcomes resistance

## Progress = Solving the Struggle

According to JTBD framework, **people don't buy products for features, they hire products to make progress.**

**Sarah's Progress Definition:**
- FROM: Anxious, drowning in spreadsheets, career at risk, behind schedule
- TO: Confident, in control, on track for compliance, respected by stakeholders

**Our Product's Job:**
Transform Sarah from "struggling compliance officer facing career-ending failure" to "strategic sustainability leader who delivered successful CSRD implementation."

❌ Sustainability project management (out of scope)
❌ Supply chain traceability (integrate with others like EcoVadis)

**Competition Strategy:** Best-in-class integrations, not all-in-one platform

# Part 3: Why This Will Succeed (JTBD Validation)

## The Four Forces Are Strongly Aligned

| Force | Strength | Why This Means Success |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| **Push** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Legal mandate + timeline pressure = companies MUST buy something |
| **Pull** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Clear transformation: chaos → control, career risk → career win |
| **Anxiety** | ⭐⭐ (Low) | Easily addressed: trials, security certs, case studies |
| **Inertia** | ⭐ (Very Low) | New requirement = no established habits to overcome |

**JTBD Score:** 165/170 - Extremely Strong

## Market Timing is Perfect

**Why 2026 is the Golden Window:**

1. **First deadline wave hits NOW**
   - Large companies reporting FY 2025 (due March 2026) = already stressed
   - Next wave (FY 2026, due March 2027) = buying NOW
   - Urgency creates willingness to pay premium

2. **December 2025 rule changes created confusion**
   - Scope narrowed (>1,000 employees + >€450M)
   - Companies unsure: "Do we qualify? What changed?"
   - Confusion = opportunity for clear solution

3. **No dominant player yet**
   - Generic ESG platforms (Workiva, Accuvio) are complex/expensive
   - Big consultants sell services, not software
   - Mid-market (€200M-€1B) is underserved
   - **First to win mid-market captures huge market**

4. **Network effects start soon**
   - First customers become case studies
   - Auditor partnerships
   - "Everyone uses Clarity CSRD" = standard
   - Lock-in through data/integrations

## Competition Analysis (JTBD Lens)

**Key Insight:** We're not competing on features, we're competing on "who best solves the job"

| Competitor | What Job They Solve | Why We Win the Job Better |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Big 4 Consultants** (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) | "Help me understand CSRD" | We solve "Do CSRD for me" - Software scales, consultants don't. €50K software vs €500K consulting |
| **Generic ESG Platforms** (Workiva, Accuvio) | "Manage all sustainability reporting" | We solve "Pass CSRD audit specifically" - Focused beats general. Better UX, lower cost |
| **Carbon Accounting** (Watershed, Persefoni) | "Measure our emissions" | We solve "Complete CSRD report" - Emissions is 1/10th of CSRD. We integrate with them |
| **Manual Excel** | "Familiar tool I understand" | We solve "Save my career and time" - Excel chaos vs. automated confidence |

**Our Differentiation:** CSRD-specific, mid-market focused, affordable, user-friendly

  - "What did you try that didn't work?"
  - "If I could solve one problem, what would it be?"
  - "Who else is involved in CSRD at your company?"
  - "What would make you confident to buy software for this?"

**Expected Learnings:**
- Which ESRS standards cause most pain? (likely E1 Climate, S1 Workers)
- What systems do they use? (SAP vs. Oracle vs. Workday)
- Budget authority: Who signs €50K purchase? (CFO, CSO, or procurement?)
- Timeline: When are they planning to start implementation?

# Part 5: Business Model (JTBD-Aligned)

## Revenue Model

**Primary:** Annual SaaS subscriptions

**Pricing Tiers (Year 2+):**

| Tier | Company Revenue | Price/Year | What's Included |
|------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Starter** | €100M-€250M | €30,000 | Single entity, ESRS core, 5 users, email support |
| **Professional** | €250M-€1B | €50,000 | Multi-entity (up to 3), full ESRS, 15 users, phone support, integrations |

| **Custom** | €5B+ | €120K+ | Everything + on-premise option, SLA guarantees, dedicated instance |

**Add-Ons:**
- Extra integrations: €5K-€10K one-time per integration
- Consulting/advisory: €200/hour (not core business but available)
- Training/workshops: €2K per session

**Payment Terms:**
- Annual prepayment (lock-in, better cash flow)
- Monthly available at 20% premium (€50K annual = €5K/month)
- Enterprise: Quarterly OK

## Unit Economics (Steady State)

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- Target: €10K per customer (marketing + sales)
- Breakdown:
  - Sales rep cost per deal: €6K
  - Marketing cost per MQL: €3K
  - Other (demos, tools): €1K

**Lifetime Value (LTV):**
- Average contract: €50K/year
- Average retention: 5 years (10% annual churn)
- Total LTV: €250K per customer
- **LTV:CAC ratio = 25:1** ✅ (Excellent, target >3:1)

**Gross Margin:**
- Software COGS (hosting, tools): €2K per customer per year
- Gross margin: 96% (typical SaaS)

**Payback Period:**
- €10K CAC / €50K annual = 2.4 months
- Target <12 months ✅

## Funding Strategy

**Bootstrapped vs. VC:**

### Option A: Bootstrapped (If You Can)
- Pros: No dilution, full control, build sustainably
- Cons: Slower growth, may lose to VC-funded competitor
- Path: Start with savings/angel, get to profitability fast, grow organically

### Option B: VC-Funded (Recommended for This Market)
- Pros: Speed to market, marketing budget, talent acquisition, network
- Cons: Dilution (20-30% per round), pressure for growth, exit expectations

**Recommended Path:**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-9): Self-Funded or Angel**
- Need: €350K for MVP
- Source: Founders contribute + angel investors
- Milestone: MVP ready, 5 design partners using it

**Phase 2 (Month 10): Seed Round**
- Raise: €1.5-€2M
- Valuation: €6-€8M pre-money (20-25% dilution)
- Use: 10 paying customers, expand to 50 customers, hire team
- Milestone: €2M ARR, product-market fit proven

**Phase 3 (Month 24): Series A**
- Raise: €8-€12M
- Valuation: €30-€40M pre-money (20-25% dilution)
- Use: EU expansion, 200 customers, €10M ARR target
- Milestone: Market leadership in BeNeLux, profitability in sight

**Investor Types to Target:**
- **Seed:** Climate tech funds (e.g., 2150, Contrarian Ventures), angel syndicates
- **Series A:** European growth funds (Accel, Index, Atomico), strategic (SAP Ventures, Salesforce Ventures)

## Key Metrics to Track

**North Star Metric:** Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

**Operational Metrics:**
- MRR growth rate (aim: 15-20% month-over-month in early days)
- CAC payback period (target: <12 months)
- Net Revenue Retention (target: >110% from upsells/expansion)
- Churn rate (target: <10% annually)
- Logo retention (target: >85% annually)

**Product Metrics:**
- Time to first report (target: <2 weeks)
- Data completeness score (target: >90% after onboarding)
- User activation (% of users who generate a report in first 30 days)
- Feature adoption (% using integrations vs. manual upload)

**Sales Metrics:**
- Pipeline coverage (3x target revenue in pipeline)
- Win rate (target: >25% of demos → customers)
- Sales cycle length (target: 45-90 days)
- Average contract value (track quarterly, aim to increase)

# Part 6: Risks & Mitigation

## Major Risks (And How We'll Handle Them)

### Risk 1: Regulation Changes Kill Market

**Scenario:** EU decides to scrap CSRD or delay it 5 years

**Likelihood:** LOW (already passed into law, companies starting to comply)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ CSRD isn't our only market - ESG reporting permanent trend
- ✅ Platform adaptable to other frameworks (GRI, TCFD, etc.)
- ✅ Diversify into broader ESG if CSRD changes
- ✅ Multi-country presence = not dependent on single regulator

### Risk 2: Big Player Crushes Us

**Scenario:** Microsoft/SAP/Workday adds CSRD module, free or cheap

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (they will eventually)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ First-mover advantage = we have customers, data, reputation first
- ✅ CSRD-specific beats generic module (focus wins)
- ✅ Better UX than enterprise software (SMBs choose us)
- ✅ Partner don't compete: integrate with them, white-label opportunity

### Risk 3: Can't Hire Good Developers

**Scenario:** Talent shortage, can't find CTO or engineers

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (competitive market)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Offer equity (startups can compete on upside)
- ✅ Remote-first (access global talent)
- ✅ Mission-driven (sustainability attracts talent)
- ✅ Fractional CTO first (advisor → full-time when funded)

### Risk 4: Customers Don't Pay / Long Sales Cycles

**Scenario:** Enterprise sales take 18 months, we run out of money

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM-HIGH (enterprise reality)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Start with mid-market (faster sales cycles)
- ✅ Urgency helps (CSRD deadlines compress timelines)
- ✅ Land-and-expand: Start with small contract, upsell later
- ✅ Ensure 18-24 months runway from fundraising

### Risk 5: Product is Too Complex to Build

**Scenario:** ESRS standards are so complicated, we can't automate

**Likelihood:** LOW-MEDIUM (technical challenge but solvable)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ MVP focuses on E1 only (prove we can do one standard well)
- ✅ Hire domain expert (CSRD consultant part-time)
- ✅ Partner with Big 4 (validate our logic)
- ✅ Iterate with real customers (they'll tell us what's wrong)

### Risk 6: Competitor Raises $50M, Outspends Us

**Scenario:** Well-funded competitor blitzes market with marketing

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (VC money flowing to climate tech)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Superior product wins (focus on JTBD, not features)
- ✅ Better customer experience (NPS >50)
- ✅ Mid-market focus (they'll chase enterprise, we dominate SMB)
- ✅ Strategic partnerships (lock in distribution channels)

---

---

# Part 8: Why This Follows JTBD Business Model

## Alignment with "When Coffee and Kale Compete" Principles

### 1. Focus on the Struggle, Not Demographics

❌ **Wrong Approach:** "Our target is sustainability managers aged 35-45 at €500M companies"

✅ **JTBD Approach:** "Our customer is anyone struggling to meet CSRD deadlines and fearing career failure, regardless of age/title"

**How we apply this:**
- Customer discovery asks: "Tell me about the last time you felt stressed about CSRD"
- Marketing speaks to the struggle: "Stop drowning in CSRD spreadsheets"
- Product solves emotional job: Relief from anxiety + confidence

### 2. Four Forces Drive Purchase Decisions

**We designed product to maximize Push/Pull, minimize Anxiety/Inertia:**

| Force | Our Strategy |
|-------|--------------|
| **Push** | Emphasize legal deadline + career risk in marketing |
| **Pull** | Show before/after: "Weeks of work → Hours" |
| **Anxiety** | Free trial, case studies, security certs, pilot program |
| **Inertia** | Low because CSRD is new (no "old way" to defend) |

### 3. Competition is Broader Than Category

**We compete with:**
- ❌ NOT just other CSRD software
- ✅ Consultants (€500K KPMG engagement)
- ✅ Excel + manual work (free but painful)
- ✅ "Do nothing and hope we don't get audited" (high risk)
- ✅ Hire full-time team (€300K+ in salaries)

**How we position:**
- "Cheaper than consultants, better than Excel, less risk than ignoring it"
- "Software that scales vs. humans who don't"

### 4. Progress Defines Value, Not Outcomes

❌ **Wrong:** "We provide CSRD-compliant reports"
✅ **Right:** "We transform you from anxious/behind-schedule → confident/on-track"

**How we sell this:**
- Sales demo focuses on Sarah's journey: "Here's Sarah before... here's Sarah after"
- Case studies talk about feelings: "I finally slept at night" not "We generated a report"
- Product celebrates progress: "🎉 Your report is 87% complete!" (not just data)

### 5. Hire Products to Make Progress

**Sarah hires our product to:**
- Fire: Stressful Excel chaos, expensive consultants, career risk
- Hire: Automated confidence, time savings, professional reputation

**How we reinforce hiring:**
- Onboarding says: "You made the right decision, here's how we'll help you win"
- Customer success measures progress: "You're 3 weeks ahead of schedule"
- Testimonials focus on transformation: "Clarity CSRD saved my job"

### 6. Build for "Job Performers" Not "Job Executors"

**Job Performer:** Person experiencing the struggle (Sarah, sustainability manager)
**Job Executor:** Person technically doing task (data entry person)

**We optimize for performer (decision maker), not executor:**
- UI designed for Sarah (non-technical, stressed, needs clarity)
- NOT designed for IT department (they don't feel the pain)
- Pricing authority: CFO/CSO (performers), not IT (executors)

# Conclusion: Why This Will Work

## The Perfect Storm of Conditions

1. **Mandatory regulation** = Guaranteed demand (50,000+ companies MUST comply)
2. **Imminent deadlines** = Urgency (2026-2028, companies buying NOW)
3. **Complexity** = High willingness to pay (CSRD is confusing, they need help)
4. **No dominant player** = Open market (mid-market especially underserved)
5. **JTBD alignment** = Strong forces (high push/pull, low anxiety/inertia)
6. **Recurring revenue** = Predictable business model (SaaS = VC fundable)
7. **Scalability** = Large TAM (EU-wide, 10+ year horizon)
8. **Founder advantage** = You understand JTBD framework deeply (competitive edge)

## The Transformation We're Enabling

**From This (Current State):**
- Sustainability manager drowning in Excel
- Spending €500K on consultants who provide PDFs
- Working 80-hour weeks, stressed, behind schedule
- Facing career risk if they fail CSRD compliance
- Company at legal risk for non-compliance

**To This (Future State):**
- Confident professional with control over CSRD process
- Automated data collection, reports generated in hours
- Normal work-life balance
- Career win: "I successfully implemented CSRD"
- Company compliant, investors satisfied, audit passed

**That transformation is worth €50K/year.**

## Next Steps

**If this pitch resonates with you:**

1. **This week:** Schedule 5 customer discovery calls
2. **This month:** Complete 30 interviews, decide GO/NO-GO
3. **Next month:** Find co-founder, start fundraising
4. **Month 4:** Begin building MVP

**If you want to discuss further:**
- Review this pitch with potential co-founder
- Share with advisors/mentors for feedback
- Run numbers with accountant/financial advisor
- Validate assumptions with 3-5 more customer calls

**The opportunity is real. The timing is perfect. The only question is: Are you ready to build it?**
