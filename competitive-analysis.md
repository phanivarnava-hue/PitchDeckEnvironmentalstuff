- **Features**: Heat stress visibility tool for rural regions
- **Limitation**: Information display, not planning simulation

**KNMI Urban Heat Island Research**
- **Function**: Research and data on UHI effect
- **Type**: Academic/research data
- **Limitation**: Not a planning tool for municipalities

### What DOESN'T Exist:

❌ "What if" simulation tools
❌ Interactive drawing capabilities for planners
❌ Temperature reduction predictions for interventions
❌ Cost-benefit comparison for different scenarios
❌ Pre-implementation testing of solutions

### Your Competitive Advantage:

✅ **Simulation functionality** - Unique in Dutch market
✅ **Predictive modeling** - Test before investing millions
✅ **Interactive planning** - Draw solutions directly on map
✅ **Decision support** - Compare multiple scenarios with quantified outcomes
✅ **Integration with existing data** - Combine ESA Copernicus with local maps

### Market Gap:

Current tools show the problem (heat maps) but don't help solve it (simulation). Urban planners need both.

### Recommendation:

**STRONG** - The simulation/prediction functionality is genuinely unique. Position as complementary to existing heat mapping tools, not competitive. Partner with RIVM/KNMI for data integration credibility.

# Pitch 4: Danish Heat-Link (District Heating Readiness Portal)

## Competition Level: ✅ MINIMAL COMPETITION

### What Exists:

**Startanalyse 2025** - PBL government tool
- **Function**: Top-down technical assessment of heating alternatives
- **Users**: Municipalities for strategy development
- **Approach**: Government analyzes feasibility
- **Limitation**: Not citizen-driven, no community engagement component

**Warmteprojectentool** - Stichting Warmtenetwerk
- **Function**: Overview of district heating network projects
- **Type**: Project tracking and information
- **Limitation**: Institutional tool, not community participation platform

**Warmtenetten Investeringssubsidie (WIS)** - RVO subsidy program
- **Function**: Financial support for district heating networks
- **Type**: Funding mechanism
- **Limitation**: Top-down allocation, no readiness assessment

### What DOESN'T Exist:

❌ Citizen crowdsourcing platform for heating readiness
❌ Bottom-up community interest aggregation
❌ 70% threshold viability trigger system
❌ Danish transparency model applied to Dutch context
❌ Social mandate demonstration tool for gemeentes
❌ Neighborhood-level readiness heatmaps

### Academic Research Validates Gap:

Recent studies document "citizen participation gaps and challenges in the heating transition" in the Netherlands. Research explicitly identifies lack of community engagement tools.

### Your Competitive Advantage:

✅ **Crowdsourcing model** - Completely unique approach
✅ **Community-led transition** - Addresses documented participation gap
✅ **Danish knowledge transfer** - Proven international model
✅ **Social viability proof** - Reduces municipal investment risk
✅ **Transparency focus** - Addresses public resistance through information
✅ **Democratic mandate** - 70% threshold gives political cover

### Market Context:

- Netherlands behind schedule on 2030 gas-free targets (1.5M homes needed, only 150K done)
- €12 billion budget available but slow deployment
- Social resistance is major blocker
- No existing tools address the social readiness dimension
