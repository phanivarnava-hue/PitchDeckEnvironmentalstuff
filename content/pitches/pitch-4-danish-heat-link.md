## Learning from Denmark to Accelerate Dutch District Heating

# The Problem

### The Netherlands faces a heating transition crisis:

- **Gas Phase-Out**: All homes must be gas-free by 2050, 7 million connections to convert
- **District Heating Solution**: Shared heat grids are the best alternative, but rollout is slow
- **Social Resistance**: Residents fear forced conversion, distrust costs, lack information
- **Planning Paralysis**: Municipalities don't know which neighborhoods are ready to switch
- **Danish Success**: Denmark has 60%+ district heating penetration - we have only 5%
- **Lost Learning**: Proven Danish model of transparency and community buy-in not applied

**Result**: Gas phase-out deadlines at risk, billions wasted on wrong neighborhoods first

# The Solution

### A democratic portal inspired by Danish best practices:

✓ **Neighbourhood Crowdsourcing**: Residents "pin" their house to show interest in district heating
✓ **Transparency**: Clear information on costs, carbon savings, and timeline (the Danish way)
✓ **Viability Threshold**: When 70% of street signs up, automatic report generated for gemeente
✓ **Social Proof**: Show neighbors that enough people are interested to make it viable
✓ **Danish Playbook**: Apply proven Danish transparency and engagement model to Dutch context

**"From resistance to readiness - let communities lead the transition"**

# How It Works

### For Residents:
1. **Explore**: View interactive map of their neighborhood
2. **Learn**: See transparent info on district heating costs vs. current gas bills
3. **Calculate**: Personal savings calculator (monthly costs, carbon reduction)
4. **Pin**: Mark their house as "interested" with one click
5. **Track Progress**: See real-time % of street committed
6. **Share**: Encourage neighbors to join via social sharing
7. **Get Updates**: Notified when threshold reached and municipality takes action

### For Municipalities:
1. **Dashboard**: See all neighborhoods and their readiness levels
2. **Heat Maps**: Visual representation of interest concentration
3. **Auto Reports**: When neighborhood hits 70%, system generates viability study
4. **Resident Data**: Understand concerns, questions, and preferences
5. **Prioritization**: Focus infrastructure investment where social buy-in exists
6. **Communication**: Direct messaging to interested residents
7. **Danish Comparison**: Benchmark against similar Danish neighborhoods

### For National Government:
1. **Monitor**: Track district heating readiness across Netherlands
2. **Identify**: Which regions are ready to move fast vs. need more education
3. **Allocate**: Direct subsidies to neighborhoods with proven demand
4. **Learn**: Which messaging and transparency works best
5. **Track**: Progress toward 2030 and 2050 gas-free targets
