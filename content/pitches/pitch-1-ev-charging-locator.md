# EV Charging Station Location Platform {.cover}

## Democratizing EV Infrastructure Planning for the Netherlands

# The Problem

### The Netherlands faces major challenges:

- **Overloaded power grid**: The Dutch electricity grid cannot handle growing demand
- **Stagnating EV adoption**: Lack of charging infrastructure prevents people from going electric
- **Inefficient planning**: Municipalities don't know where charging stations are most needed
- **Wasted investments**: Charging stations are placed without concrete demand data

**Result**: Delayed climate goals and frustrated citizens

# The Solution

### A democratic platform where:

✓ Citizens can **vote** for desired charging station locations
✓ Government makes **data-driven** decisions
✓ Supply and demand are **efficiently** matched
✓ The power grid is **strategically** managed through smart planning

**"From guesswork to data-driven infrastructure"**

# How It Works

### For Citizens:
1. **Search** your location on the map
2. **Vote** for a new charging station location
3. **See** real-time popularity of locations
4. **Get updates** when your location is planned

### For Municipalities:
1. **Dashboard** with demand heatmap
2. **Priority scores** per location
3. **Export data** to planning systems
4. **Budget optimization** tools

### For Government:
1. **Visualize** most popular locations nationwide
2. **Identify** demand hotspots across all regions
3. **Distribute funds** equitably throughout the Netherlands
4. **Prevent concentration** in the Randstad - ensure rural & peripheral areas get their fair share

# Key Features
