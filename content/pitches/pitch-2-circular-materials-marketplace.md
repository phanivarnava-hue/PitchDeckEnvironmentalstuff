# Circular Materials Marketplace {.cover}

## Turning Municipal "Waste" into Community Resources

# The Problem

### Dutch municipalities face a costly paradox:

- **Disposal costs**: Millions spent annually disposing of reusable materials (furniture, construction debris, paving stones)
- **Material waste**: Items go to landfill that local businesses and NGOs desperately need
- **Missed opportunities**: No system to connect surplus holders with those who need materials
- **Environmental impact**: Unnecessary CO2 emissions from disposal and new material production
- **Budget pressure**: Municipalities pay twice - disposal costs AND miss potential revenue

**Result**: Money wasted, resources destroyed, climate goals undermined

# The Solution

### A digital marketplace that connects municipal surplus with local demand:

✓ **Internal Dashboard**: Government departments easily list surplus assets
✓ **Public Portal**: Local businesses and NGOs bid on or claim materials
✓ **Smart Matching**: Automatic notifications when demand meets supply
✓ **Impact Tracking**: Real-time CO2 savings calculations
✓ **Carbon Credits**: Contribute to Netherlands' climate commitments

**"From waste disposal to resource circulation"**

# How It Works

### For Municipal Departments:
1. **Photograph** surplus materials (furniture, bricks, equipment)
2. **Upload** to internal inventory system with basic details
3. **Set terms**: Free, auction, or fixed price
4. **Manage** bids and arrange pickup logistics
5. **Track** disposal savings and environmental impact

### For Businesses & NGOs:
1. **Browse** available materials by category, location, and municipality
2. **Search** for specific needs (e.g., "paving stones Amsterdam")
3. **Bid or claim** materials instantly
4. **Schedule pickup** directly through platform
5. **Receive certificates** showing CO2 savings for CSR reporting

### For National Government:
1. **Monitor** circular economy progress across all municipalities
2. **Aggregate** CO2 savings for climate reporting
3. **Identify** best practices and success stories
4. **Generate** carbon credit documentation
5. **Track** contribution to national circular economy targets
